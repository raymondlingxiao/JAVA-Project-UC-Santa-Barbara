#Here into N or Y to continue or log-out(case insensitive)
#Then you could continue use the system

#Notice:
#The system will updates the information in the database after you use Check-Out, Recall and Return
#Thus it will print out the newest information about this book in the system, i.e. it will
#show you the infor after your action. I believe that will make sense.

#At last, wish you all the best and thank you so much :)
